# cyberSecurity
My first repository on GitHub
Hello this  is my first repo
I am an ethical and persistent cybersecurity learner with a strong motivation to explore ethical hacking and penetration testing. I am currently developing hands-on skills using tools like Kali Linux, while continuously improving my understanding of modern security threats and systems.

My core strengths include a high sense of integrity, the ability to adapt and learn new technologies, and a commitment to solving problems with patience and precision. I strongly value legal compliance, ethical responsibility, and the protection of personal data. My goal is to contribute to organizations that prioritize trust, privacy, and proactive defense against cyber threats.
